## File Encryption and Decryption
Simple python script to encrypt and decrypt files.
For this script I have used AES 256-bit key encryption with CFB mode from PyCryptodome Python package. 
### Installation and Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/Meeraswamy/File-Encrypt.git
cd ./File-Encrypt/
python3 main.py
```
